			<h4 class="titles">How I Spend My Freetime</h4>
			<img class="freetime-image" src="images/freetime.jpg" width="955px" height="200vh">
			<p class="freetime-sentence">Freetime can sometimes bring boredom so when it does i am sure you already know what i will do (lol), if you have forgotten, then i watch movies or listen to music. But normally, i take a walk which lasts between 20mins to 30mins, or just go and sit in the stands beside the recently constructed astro turf football field at fadama and watch football or go and stand by the roadside at darkuman-circle station and watch football at a field called black park. I sometimes also choose to be indoors and play games on my phone or laptop. Randomly, i take the oppurtunity to do things i could not do, like, visiting someone or someone visiting me, or going for available programs. I sometimes invent something new to do depending on my mood. Sundays are specifically my freetime, i play football in the morning and take a long nap afterwards if i have nothing else to do with the freetime. When i am too exhausted to do anything during my freetime, i take a long nap. </p>
	        <h4 class="titles">Hanging Out With Friends</h4>
			<img class="freetime-image" src="images/hangout.jpg" width="955px" height="200vh">
			<p class="freetime-sentence">I am an outgoing person who randomly hangout with friends or new people. Hanging out entirely depends on my mood and what i will like to do at a particular moment, the kind of friend(s) available to hangout with or the kind of new person or new people i have met. When i want to hangout, i normally go to the beach, pub or sometimes a night club with loud music. Most of the times, i hangout in the evening. I prefer evening hangouts for no particular reason. You might be wondering why i prefer evening hangouts, which is normal because i sometimes also wonder why i like the night life so much and get no better answer for myself (lol). So i conclude that, i just like it!. If you will recall, earlier i said, hanging out depends on my mood so it is not always about the night life (lol). I sometimes hangout with friends or new people at events which is for gathering (entertainment, education etc). </p>
